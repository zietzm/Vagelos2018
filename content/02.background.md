## Scientific background

### Heterogeneous networks
Networks are ubiquitous in biomedical science.
Protein-protein interaction networks, drug-target pairs, disease-symptom pairs, and more such relationship data have been produced made publicly available to biomedical researchers.
Each such relationship represents a single-type network-- a homogeneous network-- in which all relationships share a single type.
The combination and integration of many such networks results in a heterogeneous network, one in which network entities (nodes) can have connections of many different types.
For example, consider the protein "ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4" (ABCA4).
The database BioGRID contains the information that ABCA4 interacts with  serine/arginine repetitive matrix 1 (SRRM1), and details that this interaction was determined using the experimental category "Affinity Capture-Western," [@url:https://thebiogrid.org/106542/summary/homo-sapiens/abca4.html]
OMIM has the information that mutations of ABCA4 are associated with the phenotype "Retinal dystrophy, early-onset severe," [@url:https://www.omim.org/entry/601691].
Combining these two pieces of information gives a heterogeneous network, in which ABCA4 has two relationships, of types "Gene-Interacts-Gene" and "Gene-associates-Disease."
Moreover, using high-quality databses such as BioGRID, we can capture entity and relationship metadata, such as the information about how a protein-protein interaction was determined, or even DOIs for the papers in which relationships were first published.
